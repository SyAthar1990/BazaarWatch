			“I know some really f***king racist people, friends I vehemently disagree with,” actor Daniel Radcliffe recently declared in an interview for The Hollywood Reporter.

			“They’re not white supremacists, they would never be that extreme, but they are anti-immigration and absolutely voted to leave in Brexit,” Radcliffe added.

			“And I’m still friends with them because I don’t think that friendship should be drawn along those lines.”

			But, shouldn’t it? And if not, then does it really matter that you “vehemently disagree?”

			Radcliffe is currently starring in “Imperium,” a movie in which he plays an FBI agent who goes undercover in a white supremacist group, and finds himself struggling to separate what’s real and what’s fake as he tries to take the group down.

			The film seeks to explore what compels people to follow such extreme ideologies, and to humanize, in a certain sense, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. As director Daniel Ragussis said in the same Aug. 19 interview, “There are people you could probably sit with for a couple hours and have the time of your life, and all of the sudden, you find out their political beliefs and you’re shocked because you still have these common human qualities.”

			There’s definitely truth in that. Human beings are complex, our bad and good qualities are often layered so densely together that it’s difficult to paint any one individual as just one thing. For Radcliffe, and for so many people like him, that seems to be what’s at play when dealing with the blatant or casual racism of friends and family. Severing ties with friends based on their racist views, Radcliffe explained, would be “a really sad way of viewing the world.”

			Of course, it’s easy to make a statement like that when your point-of-view is one that’s never been challenged or compromised by the realities of racism. Only someone who has never been discriminated against because of their race could view racism in such abstract terms. To say that racism is a “way of viewing the world” makes it seem as if it’s just a belief system that doesn’t have real world implications for people of color.

			So many people ignore their grandpa as he complains about “foreigners” at the dinner table, or their best friend from high school ranting about Black Lives Matter on Facebook, because they can go to sleep at night with a comfortable thought:

			At least I don’t believe that. At least I’m not like them.

			White people can disagree with the racist comments of certain friends. And they can feel good about themselves for having so-called liberal, accepting opinions. But then... what? What actually changes? How do their politics actually help anyone?  Perhaps the most insidious thing about casual racism is that there is nothing actually casual about it. When it goes unchecked, it only gets worse.

			The problem with continuing to be friends with people who hold racist beliefs, however benign they may seem, isn’t the actual friendship itself. It’s human to want to remain close to someone who you love, someone who has perhaps been in your life for a very long time. The problem is the silence. Silence is complicity. That’s something every white person who feels that they are against racism should consider whenever a friend or family member sa

The film seeks to explore what compels people to follow such extreme ideologies, and to humanize, in a certain sense, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. As director Daniel Ragussis said in the same Aug. 19 interview, “There are people you could probably sit with for a couple hours and have the time of your life, and all of the sudden, you find out their political beliefs and you’re shocked because you still have these common human qualities.” 

There’s definitely truth in that. Human beings are complex, our bad and good qualities are often layered so densely together that it’s difficult to paint any one individual as just one thing. For Radcliffe, and for so many people like him, that seems to be what’s at play when dealing with the blatant or casual racism of friends and family. Severing ties with friends based on their racist views, Radcliffe explained, would be “a really sad way of viewing the world.” 

Of course, it’s easy to make a statement like that when your point-of-view is one that’s never been challenged or compromised by the realities of racism. Only someone who has never been discriminated against because of their race could view racism in such abstract terms. To say that racism is a “way of viewing the world” makes it seem as if it’s just a belief system that doesn’t have real world implications for people of color.

So many people ignore their grandpa as he complains about “foreigners” at the dinner table, or their best friend from high school ranting about Black Lives Matter on Facebook, because they can go to sleep at night with a comfortable thought:

At least I don’t believe that. At least I’m not like them. 

White people can disagree with the racist comments of certain friends. And they can feel good about themselves for having so-called liberal, accepting opinions. But then... what? What actually changes? How do their politics actually help anyone?  Perhaps the most insidious thing about casual racism is that there is nothing actually casual about it. When it goes unchecked, it only gets worse. 

The problem with continuing to be friends with people who hold racist beliefs, however benign they may seem, isn’t the actual friendship itself. It’s human to want to remain close to someone who you love, someone who has perhaps been in your life for a very long time. The problem is the silence. Silence is complicity. That’s something every white person who feels that they are against racism should consider whenever a friend or family member sa
“I know some really f***king racist people, friends I vehemently disagree with,” actor Daniel Radcliffe recently declared in an interview for The Hollywood Reporter.

“They’re not white supremacists, they would never be that extreme, but they are anti-immigration and absolutely voted to leave in Brexit,” Radcliffe added.

“And I’m still friends with them because I don’t think that friendship should be drawn along those lines.”

But, shouldn’t it? And if not, then does it really matter that you “vehemently disagree?”  

Radcliffe is currently starring in “Imperium,” a movie in which he plays an FBI agent who goes undercover in a white supremacist group, and finds himself struggling to separate what’s real and what’s fake as he tries to take the group down.
